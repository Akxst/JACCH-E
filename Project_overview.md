# Project Overview 
## Objective 

### What is the environmental effect of electrifying heat in product supply chains in Germany? 

 

## Work Package 1: Data for Production (26 October 2022) 

- Identify case study chemical production processes in ecoinvent [Con Cheddar, Ale, Hannes] 

  - Investigate heat / electricity processes – traversing supply-chain / identify technologies. 

  - Focus on 1 kg microscale for FU (optional: scaling up macro impacts for total demand in Germany later). FU: The production of 1 kg of LDPE from mixed plastic waste packaging after sorting via pyrolysis and purification in Germany in 2020, 2025, 2030. Consequential LCA. 

- Document  

## Work Package 2: Electricity (26 October 2022) 

- hourly resolved time series of power plant portfolio in German electricity mix for scenario years 2022, 2025, 2030 
- Hourly load profiles for choosen production process 
- Possible match with energy balance codes?  
- What is the flexiblity possibility
